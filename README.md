## Purpose:

**Hypothesis**  

The Impact of Social Saftey Factors with Considerations for Commercial Decisions

A look at the various clustering methodologies used in social safety factors to determine locality specific geographic zones.  Many independent repositories of data for large urban centers exist in disconnected formats.  Our study takes an in depth analysis of these factors inside Chicago, considered to be one of the least safest cities in the United States.  Applying clustering techniques on several layers to identify specific regions and time frames that create the highest level of uncertainty in decison making and reperesenting this analysis in real-time data feed to create visually indentifiable pockets of hostility, aggression, etc.  This research will reveal opportunities to improve clustering methodologies and their related techniques in processing dataflow from urban communities.  

**Abstract**  

TODO: We will develop are more professional abract from our hypothesis and research results.
